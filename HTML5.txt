``SGML is an international standard for the definition of device-independent, system-independent methods of representing texts in electronic form''
``SGML is a metalanguage, that is, a means of formally describing a language, in this case, a markup language''

This is for testing.

Where is SGML used?

managing large amounts of valuable, (predominantly) textual data
ensuring longevity of the texts
enabling interchange of data between computer platforms
facilitating interchange of data between people
allowing multiple exploitation of texts
For example:

industry: technical manuals
publishers
law firms
libraries
WWW
language data for ``language technologies'':
corpora
dictionaries, lexicons
...
